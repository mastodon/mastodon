#  win95 theme.

#  Ported over from `cybrespace:mastodon/theme_win95`.
#  <https://github.com/cybrespace/mastodon/tree/theme_win95>

#  You can use this theme file as inspiration for porting over
#  a preëxisting Mastodon theme.

#  We only modify the `common` pack, which contains our styling.
pack:
  common:
    filename: index.js
    stylesheet: true
  #  All unspecified packs will inherit from glitch.

#  The `fallback` parameter tells us to use glitch files for everything
#  we haven't specified.
fallback: glitch
