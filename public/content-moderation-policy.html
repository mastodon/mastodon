  <h2>Copyright</h2>

  <h3>How to submit a copyright notice</h3>

  <p>Mozilla will respond to takedown requests that comply with the
  Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). If you believe that
  content shared on the Mozilla.Social server infringes a copyright
  owned by you, or by someone that you legally represent, you may
  submit a takedown notice, using the procedures outlined on
  <a href=
  "https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/report-infringement/">Mozilla's
  copyright page</a>.</p>

  <h3>What happens next?</h3>

  <p>Filing a DMCA notice will commence a structured process. Your
  complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and
  completeness. If any of the required DMCA elements are missing,
  we will be unable to process your takedown request.</p>

  <p>If your complaint appears to satisfy the requirements and we
  remove the material in question, we will notify the affected
  user, and provide them with a copy of your complaint (which may
  include your personal information that is contained there). If
  you do not wish to have your information shared, you may wish to
  consider having an agent submit the complaint on your behalf. We
  will also provide the user with information about how to file a
  counter-notice, if they wish to contest your claims.</p>

  <p>If we remove material from Mozilla.social in response to your
  infringement notice, you will receive confirmation that the
  material has been removed. If we decide not to act on your
  infringement report, you also will receive a notification of that
  decision.</p>

  <p>Mozilla has a policy of terminating access for accounts that
  are repeat infringers.</p>

  <h3>What can I do if I think my content should not have been
  removed?</h3>

  <p>If something you shared was removed due to a mistake or
  misidentification by the copyright owner, you can file a DMCA
  counter-notice, using the process described on <a href=
  "https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/report-infringement/">Mozilla's
  copyright page</a>.</p>

  <h2>Trademark</h2>

  <h3>How to notify us of trademark infringement</h3>

  <p>A trademark is a word, name, logo, brand, catchphrase, or
  similar device used to identify the goods or services provided by
  a specific rightsholder. Users on our platform may not use a
  third party's trademark in a way that is likely to confuse or
  mislead others about their (or a third party's) affiliation with
  the trademark owner.</p>

  <p>Referencing or discussing a third party's trademark may not,
  on its own, violate this policy. Mozilla will not remove posts
  for using a trademark to accurately identify something, or where
  an exception to trademark law, such as fair use, applies.</p>

  <p>If you are a trademark owner or a trademark owner's authorized
  agent, and you believe that content posted on Mozilla.Social
  infringes one or more of your trademarks, please send us a
  "<strong>Trademark Notice</strong>." We handle Trademark Notices
  similarly to how we handle notices of copyright infringement, and
  require that they contain each of the following items:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A physical or electronic signature from the trademark owner
    or its authorized representative;</li>

    <li>Identification of the word, name, logo, brand, catchphrase,
    or other mark that you claim has been infringed;</li>

    <li>Sufficient information to allow us to determine the
    location of the infringement (for example, the URL where the
    infringing material is located, or the portion of a particular
    image that contains the infringed mark);</li>

    <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and an email address
    where you can be reached;</li>

    <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use
    of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized
    by the trademark owner; and</li>

    <li>A statement that the information in your Trademark Notice
    is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the
    trademark owner or are authorized to act on the owner's
    behalf.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>What can I do if my post was removed for trademark
  infringement?</h3>

  <p>If material that you posted was removed for trademark
  infringement, and you believe that it did not infringe, you can
  file a counter-notice to contest the removal of that content. If
  you wish to file a counter-notice, you can submit one at the
  following address: <a href=
  "mailto:dmcanotice@mozilla.com">dmcanotice@mozilla.com</a>.</p>

  <p>Your counter-notice must include:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A physical or electronic signature</li>

    <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to
    which access has been disabled and the location at which the
    material appeared before it was removed or access to it was
    disabled (the description from the takedown notice, or the URL
    where the content was previously posted, are acceptable).</li>

    <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good
    faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a
    result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be
    removed or disabled;</li>

    <li>Your name, physical address, and telephone number;</li>

    <li>A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal
    District Court for the judicial district in which your address
    is located, or if your address is outside of the United States,
    for any judicial district in which Mozilla may be found, and
    that you will accept service of process from the person who
    provided the takedown Notice or an agent of such person;
    and</li>

    <li>A brief explanation of the factual or legal basis of your
    counter-notice (for example, that you believe you are the
    trademark owner, or that you posted it for nominative or fair
    use purposes).</li>
  </ol>

  <h1 id="impersonation">Impersonation</h1>

  <p>Users should be able to trust that the person or organization
  indicated by another account's name or profile is authentic, and
  genuinely represents the account's owner. You therefore may not
  impersonate others, and may not post material intended to deceive
  others about your identity, or about your authority to speak or
  act on behalf of a third party. However, clear parody or satire
  accounts are not considered violations of this policy.</p>

  <p>While your profile is not required to display your own name or
  picture, you also may not use it to pose as a third party -
  whether real or imagined - in order to deceive others.</p>

  <p>Violations of this policy may include accounts posing as an
  authorized representative of a particular business, accounts
  offering misleading investment, employment, or financial deals,
  or other accounts displaying counterfeit identities, or offering
  unauthorized or counterfeit goods or services.</p>

  <p>If you discover an account that you believe is impersonating
  another person, or is purporting to represent a person or entity
  that it is not entitled to represent, you can report that account
  to us via the reporting tools available to you on Mozilla.Social.
  Please identify the specific account in question, as well as the
  account, individual, or entity that you believe is being
  impersonated without authorization.</p>

  <p>If further information is likely to help clarify your concerns
  (for example, if the impersonation was done in a specific post),
  please also share those details. You will also be asked to
  provide your contact information, so that we can contact you with
  further questions, and with updates on your complaint. For more
  information about how we store your information, see the
  Mozilla.social Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h1 id="harassment">Harassment</h1>

  <p>Mozilla.Social users should be able to express their opinions,
  and to engage in passionate and open dialogue without becoming
  subject (or subjecting others) to bullying or harassment. With
  that in mind, Mozilla will remove posts that appear to be shared
  for the purpose of diminishing, degrading or shaming others,
  causing them fear, or otherwise tormenting them. Egregious or
  repeated violations of this policy may result in permanent
  suspension of the user's account.</p>

  <p>This does not mean that we will remove posts, or accounts,
  simply for stating controversial ideas. Mozilla believes that the
  best discussions occur in an environment where people feel
  comfortable sharing diverse points of view, and will not label
  something as harassment simply because it includes unpopular
  viewpoints. That said, it will remove posts that appear to be
  targeted at a particular individual or group, that contain
  personal abuse, or that appear to be shared in order to cause
  others discomfort.</p>

  <p>Mozilla is committed to making Mozilla.Social a space that
  reflects our <a href=
  "https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">values</a>). The
  line between forcefully expressed opinion and harassment can be
  hard to judge. If you are not sure whether a behavior would
  constitute harassment, it's best to avoid that behavior. We may
  sometimes make moderation decisions that you feel err on the side
  of removing content but we will always try to strike a balance
  that promotes healthy community and constructive debate. If you
  are looking for a social network that permits all speech, without
  limitation, Mozilla.Social may not be the right place for
  you.</p>

  <p>Harassment can come in many forms, and is not just at the
  level of person to person interaction. On Mozilla.Social, we will
  remove posts or accounts who incite or encourage harassment
  against other people (e.g. <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogpiling_(Internet)">dogpiling</a>),
  public shaming, doxxing and/or releasing other forms of private
  and identifying information, and <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting">swatting</a>. Mozilla
  will also disable posts that contain explicit or veiled threats,
  or that appear to target an individual based on that person's
  membership in a particular social, cultural, political, or other
  class, such as their race, gender, sexual identity, sexual
  orientation, gender identity, familial status, national or
  regional origin, language, education level, income level, or
  equivalent.</p>

  <p>Messages sent to a single individual may constitute
  harassment, depending on the wording of the message and the
  context in which it was sent. While uninvited or controversial
  private posts may not, on their own, constitute harassment, one
  that appears intended to belittle or intimidate the receiver,
  that is sent as part of a coordinated or ongoing campaign, or
  that is sent after a request to cease contact, is more likely to
  be a violation. Similarly, persistent and repeated sexual
  pressure or badgering in private or public posts may also violate
  our harassment policy.</p>

  <p>If you find that someone makes upsetting comments or
  statements that may not rise to the level of
  &#226;&#8364;&#339;harassment,&#226;&#8364; you can <a href=
  "https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/">choose not to
  see their posts</a>, and/or to block private messages from
  them.</p>

  <h2>Violent content</h2>

  <p>Mozilla.Social users may not use the platform to glorify or
  promote terrorism or violence. We will remove accounts owned by
  the perpetrators of violent or terrorist acts (explained more in
  our policy on terrorism and violent organizations), as well as
  those accounts that coordinate, incite, mock, or celebrate
  violence against any individuals, groups, entities, or
  others.</p>

  <p>Users may not share content that depicts abuse of humans or
  animals, or that includes excessively gory or violent imagery
  that, even if meant to be
  &#226;&#8364;&#339;informational&#226;&#8364; (e.g. graphic
  images of death, visible wounds, mutilation, etc.), can disturb
  other users. We will remove content that incites or facilitates
  violence, or appears intended to do so, and will suspend accounts
  that post or share such content. Users also may not use the
  platform to advocate for, or to attempt to encourage others to
  commit violent acts. We will remove, and encourage users to
  report, content indicating a user or third party's intent to
  cause real-world injuries to others. Where we believe there is a
  serious risk of harm to individuals or to public safety, we may
  also report such content to law enforcement, and will work with
  law enforcement agencies as necessary to investigate and address
  the threat.</p>

  <p>When enforcing this policy, we will consider the context in
  which a post is shared, in determining whether a violation has
  occurred. For example, media that depicts violence by state
  actors or other newsworthy violent events will typically be
  permitted for informational purposes, but not for the purpose of
  glorifying or promoting the violence in question. While not
  required, if your posts contain such material, we strongly
  encourage you to use the Content Warning feature available to you
  as a Mozilla.Social user so that other users can choose whether
  or not to view your post.</p>

  <h2>Self-Harm</h2>

  <p>Users may not use the platform to glorify or promote
  self-harm. This includes deliberate self-harm, such as suicide,
  cutting, ingesting dangerous substances, and similar activities.
  It also includes promotion of content that is inherently harmful,
  such as content that encourages, or aims to foster eating
  disorders and body dysmorphia.</p>

  <p>Content that would otherwise be forbidden under this policy
  may be allowed for news purposes, or when shared to facilitate
  healthy discussion and education. Content also will not be
  automatically deemed to violate this policy simply because it
  discusses nutrition or weight loss, or because it includes images
  of a particular body type. Rather, such content will be analyzed
  holistically, based on the content in which it was presented.</p>

  <h2>Sexualized content</h2>

  <p>Under the sexualized content policy, Mozilla.Social users may
  not share pornographic materials; images, posts, and videos
  depicting sexual violence; advocate or glorify non-consensual
  sexual acts. Users are also prohibited from
  &#226;&#8364;&#339;outing&#226;&#8364; victims of sexual assault,
  and may not use the platform to advertise for or to solicit
  sexual acts and/or encounters. Deep fakes and altered images that
  depict people in sexual acts will be removed, and can fall under
  some of our other policies (<a href=
  "#impersonation">impersonation</a> and <a href=
  "#harassment">harassment</a>, in particular)</p>

  <p>Content that involves, encourages, or facilitates the
  sexualization and sexual abuse of minors is also prohibited (see
  <a href="#child-sexual-abuse">Child Sexual Abuse</a> policy) and
  may result in criminal action against you.</p>

  <p>Posts that contain partial nudity (e.g. bathing suits,
  lingerie, revealing clothing, breastfeeding, etc.) are not
  prohibited under this policy. Posts that contain images or video
  of bare breasts that show nipples - regardless of gender identity
  - are allowed as long as they are (a) being shared with the
  consent of, and/or by the person depicted in the images (b) not a
  part of a post that is depicting an explicit sexual act (e.g.
  pornography) and (c) is not depicting a minor (since minors
  cannot freely give consent, and content involving them generally
  falls under the Child Sexual Exploitation Policy).</p>

  <p>Conversations about sex, sexual acts, reproductive healthcare,
  childbirth, etc. are also allowed and do not fall under the
  sexualized content policy. Conversations that glorify or describe
  violent sexual acts, name victims of sexual assault without their
  consent, or harass other users for their sexual orientation,
  reproductive healthcare choices, etc. are prohibited.</p>

  <h1 id="child-sexual-abuse">Child Sexual Abuse</h1>

  <p>Mozilla.Social does not permit any content that includes,
  promotes, depicts, or advocates for any form of child sexual
  exploitation. Such content may include media, text,
  illustrations, or links to third party websites that host child
  sexual exploitation materials. It includes any actual or implied
  depiction of, or support for children engaging in sexual
  activity, as well as discussion of a user's participation in or
  desire for such activity.</p>

  <p>Any attempt to solicit Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM),
  nude or sexualized images of children, or real-world sexual
  encounters with a child (an individual under age 18) is a
  violation of this policy. This policy also prohibits any attempts
  to engage in sexually-explicit conversations with, to exchange
  sexually-explicit information or media with a child on the
  platform, or to promote or normalize sexual attraction to
  minors.</p>

  <p>It is also a violation of this policy to name or share images
  of any alleged victim of child sexual exploitation, except where
  such information or images is shared by the victim themself.
  (Explicit photographs of a minor are prohibited, even when shared
  by the minor subject.) However, this policy does not prohibit
  discussion of, or advocacy for a minor's access to birth control
  or sexual health services, as long as such services are not aimed
  at facilitating or concealing a sexual relationship between an
  adult and a minor.</p>

  <p>Violation of this policy will result in immediate deactivation
  of the offending account. Most violations will also be reported
  to law enforcement and/or to the National Center for Missing and
  Exploited Children (NCMEC). When this occurs, violators may not
  be immediately notified of the action against their account.</p>

  <h2>Violations of Third Party Privacy</h2>

  <p>Protection of individual privacy is one of Mozilla's core
  values. We do not allow users to post confidential information
  about others, except in certain cases where that information is a
  subject of public concern (such as when it has appeared in a
  major news outlet or public document and is important to the
  related news coverage or discussion).</p>

  <p>We may remove content that provides a third party's contact
  information, details about their location or residence, or their
  medical, familial, sexual or other private background details, as
  well as content that shares copies of identification, financial,
  educational or medical documents. We also will not permit content
  in which a user threatens to expose another's personal
  information, whether or not such exposure actually occurs.</p>

  <p>We also do not allow users to post their own personal
  information where sharing that information is likely to cause
  significant harm to the user who shared it (for example, a Social
  Security Number or National ID number, address, a bank pin code,
  or a website or computer password). Relatedly, we do not allow
  posts or links that seek to obtain other users' financial,
  medical or personal information. We will remove such posts when
  they are brought to our attention.</p>

  <h2>Misinformation</h2>

  <p>Misinformation and deliberate falsehoods are dangerous and
  threaten the fabric of a healthy democratic society. Many of us
  have seen firsthand the dangers of such falsehoods becoming
  normalized and mainstreamed within our societies, as well as the
  violence that it can cause.</p>

  <p>On Mozilla.Social, we want to encourage healthy conversations
  and debates, but want to ensure that this is done without
  spreading misinformation and disinformation on our platform -
  misinformation is content that the person sharing may or may not
  be aware that it is false, whereas disinformation is deliberately
  false and meant to create chaos, uncertainty, and in many cases,
  radicalize.</p>

  <p>Both misinformation and disinformation are not allowed on
  Mozilla.Social. Posts containing demonstrably false information
  and/or conspiracy theories that can cause real-world harm, or
  that appear likely to radicalize others or encourage violent acts
  against disenfranchised communities, or to encourage political
  and social violence, will be removed.</p>

  <p>Posts that speculate about mainstream cultural events or
  public figures (e.g. celebrity gossip or equivalent thereof) are
  not prohibited under this policy, unless the posts appear to be
  spreading deliberate falsehoods to impact or influence public
  opinion, or to encourage harassment or harm of individuals.</p>

  <p>Accounts that repeatedly violate this policy will be
  suspended. Before sharing information, double check its source
  and practice good digital literacy measures. If you think that
  anything is in violation of this policy, please report it to the
  admins.</p>

  <h2>Promotion of illegal goods</h2>

  <p>Users may not use Mozilla's platform to traffic in, purchase,
  sell, or trade illegal or goods and services that are legally
  restricted, under applicable law. A non-exhaustive list of such
  goods includes</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Weapons, firearms, ammunitions, explosives, or instructions
    on how to create or build these items</li>

    <li>Medications, drugs, and controlled substances, including
    cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol</li>

    <li>Sexual services</li>

    <li>Products made from endangered animals</li>

    <li>Human blood, organs, body parts, or skeletal remains</li>

    <li>Gambling (with real money)</li>

    <li>Services that involve trafficking in, trading, or or
    enslaving human beings</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Users may discuss the use or trade of such items, or debate
  the merits of legally restricting such items, without running
  afoul of this policy. However, users may not instruct other users
  on where such items can be obtained or sold, nor can they attempt
  to facilitate or advertise their own involvement in related
  transactions.</p>

  <h2>Fraud/Counterfeit goods</h2>

  <p>Mozilla does not permit any activity that appears intended to
  deceive or defraud others, or to misrepresent the source and
  authenticity of goods, in order to obtain money, property, or
  other material gains. It also does not permit any activity in
  which a user seeks to pass off a third party's goods or services
  (including digital goods and services), as their own, or
  misleadingly purports to be trading on behalf of someone else.
  This policy prohibits (among other things) the offer or promotion
  of fraudulent or misleading investments, loans, jobs, or business
  opportunities, as well as the solicitation of charitable
  donations for any purpose other than that for which they are
  advertised.</p>

  <p>Similarly, we do not allow users to coordinate with each other
  for the purpose of defrauding or deceiving third parties. This
  includes any attempts to trade in fake identity, financial,
  business, educational, or other documents and records;
  unauthorized exchanges of third party property or personal
  information; and efforts to mislead third party businesses or
  individuals.</p>

  <p>Violators of this rule will be suspended from
  Mozilla.Social</p>

  <p>This rule does not prohibit discussion of fraudulent activity,
  nor does it prohibit individuals from discussing or promoting
  legitimate businesses, charities, or investments.</p>

  <h2>Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content</h2>

  <p>Mozilla.Social prohibits content and/or accounts posted by or
  belonging to terrorist organizations and individuals, as defined
  by applicable law. This also includes the promotion and
  glorification of terrorist individuals, organizations, and acts.
  Content that is meant to spread extremist ideology is also
  prohibited. Violent organizations that may or may not be
  classified formally as terrorist groups also will be banned from
  the platform.</p>

  <p>Any accounts that are being maintained by perpetrators of
  violent extremist, terrorist, or mass violent attacks will be
  removed, regardless of the account owner's membership in
  recognized terrorist or violent organizations.</p>

  <p>Since we want Mozilla.Social to be a safe space, we will also
  prohibit the sharing of hateful or violent manifestos or similar
  content produced by perpetrators of violent and/or terrorist
  attacks. Although manifestos are often shared following these
  kinds of tragedies, even by news organizations, this continues to
  indirectly assist in the spread of these violent and extremist
  ideologies and centers the perpetrators of these attacks rather
  than the victims of such violence.</p>

  <p>Because of this, posts containing manifestos in any form
  (including outside links, excerpts, full-length manifestos,
  videos, screenshots and images) or other content created by
  perpetrators of terrorist and violent attacks will be removed.
  Even if the intention of the post is not meant to glorify the
  ideology or the perpetrator, we have a duty and responsibility to
  ensure that hateful ideologies are not being promoted or shared
  on our platform.</p>

  <h2>Hate Speech</h2>

  <p>To ensure an inclusive and safe environment, hate speech and
  derogatory language is not permitted on Mozilla.Social. Aligned
  with Mozilla's values as well as Mastodon's Server Covenant to
  actively moderate against hateful speech, posts (this includes
  text, audio, video, and images) that contain derogatory and/or
  hateful language about the following will be removed:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Family status</li>

    <li>Gender</li>

    <li>Gender identity or expression</li>

    <li>Marital status</li>

    <li>Sex</li>

    <li>Sexual orientation</li>

    <li>Native language</li>

    <li>Age</li>

    <li>Ability</li>

    <li>Race and/or ethnicity</li>

    <li>Caste</li>

    <li>National origin</li>

    <li>Socioeconomic status</li>

    <li>Religion</li>

    <li>Geographic location</li>

    <li>Other physical, social or cultural attributes or
    classifications</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Posts that target and/or attack other users containing hateful
  language focusing on the above are not acceptable. This includes
  deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not
  identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an
  individual's gender identity. Although more considered along the
  lines of potential bullying and harassment, posts that engage in
  outing an LGBTQIA+ person without their consent will also be
  removed.</p>

  <p>Simply put, if you're unsure if a word is derogatory, don't
  use it. Under this policy, phrases, words, images, memes, videos,
  and/or emojis that are <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_whistle_(politics)">dog
  whistles</a> meant to encourage hatred toward a certain group or
  individual based on the above characteristics will also be
  removed.</p>

  <p>Angry posts, or posts that criticize a specific group based on
  that group's opinions or similar characteristics, will not be
  forbidden under this policy. Similarly, certain things that might
  be considered hate speech may not be removed if the context in
  which they were shared, indicates that the post itself was not
  intended to attack or inspire enmity against another group (for
  example, a news photograph of a hateful symbol painted on a
  building might be permitted, even if the same hateful symbol was
  forbidden in other contexts). Similarly, posts may be permitted
  where the writer refers to themself in a way that might seem
  hateful when used to refer to others (as long as the post does
  not violate one of our other policies, such as the policy against
  Self-Harm). Words with multiple meanings may be removed in one
  context, but permitted in another.</p>

  <p>People who violate this policy repeatedly, or who violate it
  in an egregious manner, will be removed from the platform.</p>
