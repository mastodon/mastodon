# This is a Docker Compose file for deploying Mastodon. It is designed to be used with the `docker compose` command.
# This file is designed as a starting point for your production server deployment, not local development work!
# For a containerized local dev environment, see: https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/README.md#docker

# You should check the Docker image tag used for the web, sidekiq, and streaming containers to make sure you are running
# the appropriate version for your deployment. Using `nightly` will deploy the in-development version of Mastodon, which is
# not considered a stable release. Visit https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases for currently released versions and tags.

# Change the `image-tag` value to the desired version tag, e.g. `4.3.0`, `4.3.1`, etc.

  &image-tag nightly

  # This is the Mastodon background worker. It processes jobs such fetching posts from other servers and sending e-mails.

  # You can run multiple Sidekiq processes to handle more jobs concurrently. The scheduler queue must only be run on one process.

# Mastodon requires Redis for caching and Sidekiq job processing, and PostgreSQL for data storage.
# Nginx is required for securely serving the web interface and streaming API to users.
# Elasticsearch is optional but recommended for better search functionality.
# You can use the official images for these services. Please refer to their documentation for more information.
