Followers-only posts are delivered to your followers and users who are mentioned in them, and direct posts are delivered only to users mentioned in them. In some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to those posts only to authorized persons, but other servers may fail to do so. Therefore it&#39;s important to review servers your followers belong to. You may toggle an option to approve and reject new followers manually in the settings. <strong>Please keep in mind that the operators of the server and any receiving server may view such messages</strong>, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. <strong>Do not share any sensitive information over Mastodon.</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>IPs and other metadata</strong>: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. All the logged in sessions are available for your review and revocation in the settings. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h1>What do we use your information for?</h1>

                      <li>To provide the core functionality of Mastodon. You can only interact with other people&#39;s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may follow other people to view their combined posts in your own personalized home timeline.</li>
                      <li>To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.</li>
                      <li>The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>

                      <h1>How do we protect your information?</h1>

                      <p>Your public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and followers-only posts are delivered to the servers where your followers reside, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those followers or recipients reside on a different server than this.</p>

                      <p>When you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your following list, your followers, your lists, all your posts, and your favourites. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password.</p>
