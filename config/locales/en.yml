You may toggle an option to approve and reject new followers manually in the settings. <em>Please keep in mind that the operators of the server and any receiving server may view such messages</em>, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. <em>Do not share any dangerous information over Mastodon.</em></li>
