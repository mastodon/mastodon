For this reason, it is best to keep this information clear, short and concise.

      security:
        authorized_fetch: Require authentication from federated servers
        authorized_fetch_hint: Requiring authentication from federated servers enables stricter enforcement of both user-level and server-level blocks. However, this comes at the cost of a performance penalty, reduces the reach of your replies, and may introduce compatibility issues with some federated services. In addition, this will not prevent dedicated actors from fetching your public posts and accounts.
        authorized_fetch_overridden_hint: You are currently unable to change this setting because it is overridden by an environment variable.

      feature_control: You know best what you want to see on your home feed. No algorithms or ads to waste your time. Follow anyone across any Mastodon server from a single account and receive their posts in chronological order, and make your corner of the Internet a little more like you.
      feature_control_title: Stay in control of your own timeline
      feature_creativity: Mastodon supports audio, video and picture posts, accessibility descriptions, polls, content warnings, animated avatars, custom emojis, thumbnail crop control, and more, to help you express yourself online. Whether you're publishing your art, your music, or your podcast, Mastodon is there for you.

      feature_moderation: Mastodon puts decision making back in your hands. Each server creates their own rules and regulations, which are enforced locally and not top-down like corporate social media, making it the most flexible in responding to the needs of different groups of people. Join a server with the rules you agree with, or host your own.
