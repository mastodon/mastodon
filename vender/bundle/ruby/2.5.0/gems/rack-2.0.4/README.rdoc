= Rack, a modular Ruby webserver interface {<img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/rack/rack.svg" alt="Build Status" />}[http://travis-ci.org/rack/rack] {<img src="https://gemnasium.com/rack/rack.svg" alt="Dependency Status" />}[https://gemnasium.com/rack/rack]

Rack provides a minimal, modular, and adaptable interface for developing
web applications in Ruby.  By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in
the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web
servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called
middleware) into a single method call.

The exact details of this are described in the Rack specification,
which all Rack applications should conform to.

== Supported web servers

The included *handlers* connect all kinds of web servers to Rack:
* WEBrick
* FCGI
* CGI
* SCGI
* LiteSpeed
* Thin

These web servers include Rack handlers in their distributions:
* Ebb
* Fuzed
* Glassfish v3
* Phusion Passenger (which is mod_rack for Apache and for nginx)
* Puma
* Reel
* Unicorn
* unixrack
* uWSGI
* yahns

Any valid Rack app will run the same on all these handlers, without
changing anything.

== Supported web frameworks

These frameworks include Rack adapters in their distributions:
* Camping
* Coset
* Espresso
* Halcyon
* Mack
* Maveric
* Merb
* Racktools::SimpleApplication
* Ramaze
* Ruby on Rails
* Rum
* Sinatra
* Sin
* Vintage
* Waves
* Wee
* ... and many others.

== Available middleware

Between the server and the framework, Rack can be customized to your
applications needs using middleware, for example:
* Rack::URLMap, to route to multiple applications inside the same process.
* Rack::CommonLogger, for creating Apache-style logfiles.
* Rack::ShowException, for catching unhandled exceptions and
  presenting them in a nice and helpful way with clickable backtrace.
* Rack::File, for serving static files.
* ...many others!

All these components use the same interface, which is described in
detail in the Rack specification.  These optional components can be
used in any way you wish.

== Convenience

If you want to develop outside of existing frameworks, implement your
own ones, or develop middleware, Rack provides many helpers to create
Rack applications quickly and without doing the same web stuff all
over:
* Rack::Request, which also provides query string parsing and
  multipart handling.
* Rack::Response, for convenient generation of HTTP replies and
  cookie handling.
* Rack::MockRequest and Rack::MockResponse for efficient and quick
  testing of Rack application without real HTTP round-trips.

== rack-contrib

The plethora of useful middleware created the need for a project that
collects fresh Rack middleware.  rack-contrib includes a variety of
add-on components for Rack and it is easy to contribute new modules.

== rackup

rackup is a useful tool for running Rack applications, which uses the
Rack::Builder DSL to configure middleware and build up applications
easily.

rackup automatically figures out the environment it is run in, and
runs your application as FastCGI, CGI, or WEBrick---all from the
same configuration.

== Quick start

Try the lobster!

Either with the embedded WEBrick starter:

    ruby -Ilib lib/rack/lobster.rb

Or with rackup:

    bin/rackup -Ilib example/lobster.ru

By default, the lobster is found at http://localhost:9292.

== Installing with RubyGems

A Gem of Rack is available at rubygems.org.  You can install it with:

    gem install rack

I also provide a local mirror of the gems (and development snapshots)
at my site:

    gem install rack --source http://chneukirchen.org/releases/gems/

== Running the tests

Testing Rack requires the bacon testing framework:

    bundle install --without extra # to be able to run the fast tests

Or:

    bundle install # this assumes that you have installed native extensions!

There is a rake-based test task:

    rake test       tests all the tests

The testsuite has no dependencies outside of the core Ruby
installation and bacon.

To run the test suite completely, you need:

  * fcgi
  * memcache-client
  * thin

The full set of tests test FCGI access with lighttpd (on port
9203) so you will need lighttpd installed as well as the FCGI
libraries and the fcgi gem:

Download and install lighttpd:

    http://www.lighttpd.net/download

Installing the FCGI libraries:

    curl -O http://www.fastcgi.com/dist/fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz
    tar xzvf fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz
    cd fcgi-2.4.0
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    make
    sudo make install
    cd ..

Installing the Ruby fcgi gem:

    gem install fcgi

Furthermore, to test Memcache sessions, you need memcached (will be
run on port 11211) and memcache-client installed.

== Configuration

Several parameters can be modified on Rack::Utils to configure Rack behaviour.

e.g:

    Rack::Utils.key_space_limit = 128

=== key_space_limit

The default number of bytes to allow a single parameter key to take up.
This helps prevent a rogue client from flooding a Request.

Default to 65536 characters (4 kiB in worst case).

=== multipart_part_limit

The maximum number of parts a request can contain.
Accepting too many part can lead to the server running out of file handles.

The default is 128, which means that a single request can't upload more than 128 files at once.

Set to 0 for no limit.

Can also be set via the RACK_MULTIPART_PART_LIMIT environment variable.
