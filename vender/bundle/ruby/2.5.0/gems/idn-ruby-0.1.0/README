== LibIDN Ruby Bindings

Version 0.1.0

Ruby Bindings for the GNU LibIDN library, an implementation of the
Stringprep, Punycode and IDNA specifications defined by the IETF
Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) working group.

Included are the most important parts of the Stringprep, Punycode
and IDNA APIs like performing Stringprep processings, encoding to
and decoding from Punycode strings and converting entire domain names
to and from the ACE encoded form.

The latest version of the LibIDN Ruby Bindings project and its
documentation can always be found at

* http://rubyforge.org/projects/idn

See the CHANGES file for detailed information on the changes of every
released version.


=== Requirements

* GNU LibIDN[http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/] Library

* Rake[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rake] to run the tests and generate
  the documentation

* RubyGems[http://docs.rubygems.org/] to produce a Gem package

* Ruby 1.9.1 or above. Patches welcome to make this work in 1.8.7


=== Installation

You can easily install the LibIDN Ruby Bindings by following one of the
ways outlined below:

==== Automatic installation and management with RubyGems

Simply invoke the standard RubyGems commands (install, update, ...),
for example:

  % gem install --remote --test idn

or if the GNU LibIDN library can only be found in a non-standard location

  % gem install --remote --test idn -- \
      --with-idn-dir=/path/to/non/standard/location

or in an even more complex setup

  % gem install --remote --test idn -- \
      --with-idn-lib=/path/to/non/standard/location/lib \
      --with-idn-include=/path/to/non/standard/location/include

==== Semi-automatic installation with Rake

If you are not able to or don't want to use RubyGems you can simply
download the latest release and install it with the help of Rake:

  % tar -xvzf idn-x.x.x.tar.gz
  % cd idn-x.x.x

  % rake install

or if the GNU LibIDN library can only be found in a non-standard location

  % rake install IDN_DIR=/path/to/non/standard/location

You can also run the tests or generate the documentation; just call Rake
with the '--tasks' parameter to get an overview of the available tasks:

  % rake --tasks

==== Manual installation with extconf.rb

If you are not able to or don't want to use even Rake then you will have to
do a little bit more work by yourself:

  % tar -xvzf idn-x.x.x.tar.gz
  % cd idn-x.x.x/ext

  % ruby extconf.rb

or if the GNU LibIDN library can only be found in a non-standard location

  % ruby extconf.rb \
      --with-idn-dir=/path/to/non/standard/location

or in an even more complex setup

  % ruby extconf.rb \
      --with-idn-lib=/path/to/non/standard/location/lib \
      --with-idn-include=/path/to/non/standard/location/include

and finally

  % make
  % sudo make install


=== Documentation

The complete documentation is available online at

* http://idn.rubyforge.org/docs

See also the section on 'Semi-automatic installation with Rake' above for
some details on how to generate the documentation by yourself.

==== Example usage

  require 'idn'
  include IDN

  puts 'Idna.toUnicode: ' + Idna.toUnicode('xn--rksmrgs-5wao1o.josefsson.org')
  puts 'Punycode.decode: ' + Punycode.decode('egbpdaj6bu4bxfgehfvwxn')
  puts 'Stringprep.with_profile: ' + Stringprep.with_profile('FOO', 'Nameprep')
