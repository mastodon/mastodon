# Contributing

## Issues

When opening an issue:

* include the full **backtrace** with your error
* include your Sidekiq initializer
* list versions you are using: Ruby, Rails, Sidekiq, OS, etc.

It's always better to include more info rather than less.

## Code

It's always best to open an issue before investing a lot of time into a
fix or new functionality.  Functionality must meet my design goals and
vision for the project to be accepted; I would be happy to discuss how
your idea can best fit into Sidekiq.

## Legal

By submitting a Pull Request, you disavow any rights or claims to any changes
submitted to the Sidekiq project and assign the copyright of
those changes to Contributed Systems LLC.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment
contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR.
Open an issue and someone else can do the work.

This is a legal way of saying "If you submit a PR to us, that code becomes ours".
99.9% of the time that's what you intend anyways; we hope it doesn't scare you
away from contributing.
