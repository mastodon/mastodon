5.3.0 (2018-03-09):

* Improvement: Use `FactoryBot` instead of `FactoryGirl` (https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/pull/2501)
* Improvement: README updates (https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/pull/2411, https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/pull/2433, https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/pull/2374, https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/pull/2417, https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/pull/2536)

5.2.1 (2018-01-25):

* Bugfix: Fix copying files on Windows. (#2532)

5.2.0 (2018-01-23):

* Security: Remove the automatic loading of URI adapters. Some of these
  adapters can be specially crafted to expose your network topology. (#2435)
* Bugfix: The rake task no longer rescues `Exception`. (#2476)
* Bugfix: Handle malformed `Content-Disposition` headers (#2283)
* Bugfix: The `:only_process` option works when passed a lambda again. (#2289)
* Improvement: Added `:use_accelerate_endpoint` option when using S3 to enable
  [Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html)
  (#2291)
* Improvement: Make the fingerprint digest configurable per attachment. The
  default remains MD5. Making this configurable means it can change in a future
  version because it is not considered secure anymore against intentional file
  corruption. For more info, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Security

  You can change the digest used for an attachment by adding the
  `:adapter_options` parameter to the `has_attached_file` options like this:
  `has_attached_file :avatar, adapter_options: { hash_digest: Digest::SHA256 }`

  Use the rake task to regenerate fingerprints with the new digest for a given
  class. Note that this does **not** check the file integrity using the old
  fingerprint. Run the following command to regenerate fingerprints for all
  User attachments:
  `CLASS=User rake paperclip:refresh:fingerprints`
  You can optionally limit the attachment that will be processed, e.g:
  `CLASS=User ATTACHMENT=avatar rake paperclip:refresh:fingerprints` (#2229)
* Improvement: The new `frame_index` option on the thumbnail processor allows
  you to select a specific frame from an animated upload to use as a thumbnail.
  Initial support is for mkv, avi, MP4, mov, MPEG, and GIF. (#2155)
* Improvement: Instead of copying files, use hard links. This is an
  optimization. (#2120)
* Improvement: S3 storage option `:s3_prefixes_in_alias`. (#2287)
* Improvement: Fog option `:fog_public` can be a lambda. (#2302)
* Improvement: One fewer warning on JRuby. (#2352)
* Ruby 2.4.0 compatibility (doesn't use Fixnum anymore)

5.1.0 (2016-08-19):

* Improvement: Add `fog_options` configuration to send options to fog when
  storing files.
* Extracted repository for locales only:  https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip-i18n
* Bugfix: Original file could be unlinked during `post_process_style`, producing failures
* Bugfix for image magick scaling images up
* Memory consumption improvements
* `url` on a unpersisted record returns `default_url` rather than `nil`
* Improvement: aws-sdk v2 support
  https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/pull/1903

  If your Gemfile contains aws-sdk (>= 2.0.0) and aws-sdk-v1, paperclip will use
  aws-sdk v2. With aws-sdk v2, S3 storage requires you to set the s3_region.
  s3_region may be nested in s3_credentials, and (if not nested in
  s3_credentials) it may be a Proc.

      class AddAttachmentToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
        def self.up
          create_table :users do |t|
            t.attachment :avatar

  `ActiveRecord::Base` instead of requiring `paperclip/railtie`:

      ActiveRecord::Base.send :include, Paperclip::Glue

* Bug Fix: AttachmentContentTypeValidator now allow you to specify :allow_blank/:allow_nil

  filesystem conflicts and scales to handle larger numbers of uploads.

  The easiest way to upgrade is to add an explicit :url and :path to your
  has_attached_file calls:

      has_attached_file :avatar,
        :path => ":rails_root/public/system/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename",
        :url => "/system/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename"

* Bug Fix: Generating missing attachment styles for a model which has had its attachment changed should not raise.
* Bug Fix: Do not collide with the built-in Ruby hashing method.
