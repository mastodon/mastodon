== Description

Pg is the Ruby interface to the {PostgreSQL RDBMS}[http://www.postgresql.org/].

It works with {PostgreSQL 9.1 and later}[http://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/].

A small example usage:

  #!/usr/bin/env ruby

  require 'pg'

  # Output a table of current connections to the DB
  conn = PG.connect( dbname: 'sales' )
  conn.exec( "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity" ) do |result|
    puts "     PID | User             | Query"
    result.each do |row|
      puts " %7d | %-16s | %s " %
        row.values_at('procpid', 'usename', 'current_query')
    end
  end

== Requirements

* Ruby 2.2
* PostgreSQL 9.1.x or later (with headers, -dev packages, etc).

It usually work with earlier versions of Ruby/PostgreSQL as well, but those are
not regularly tested.


== How To Install

Install via RubyGems:

    gem install pg

You may need to specify the path to the 'pg_config' program installed with
Postgres:

    gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=<path to pg_config>

If you're installing via Bundler, you can provide compile hints like so:

    bundle config build.pg --with-pg-config=<path to pg_config>

See README-OS_X.rdoc for more information about installing under MacOS X, and
README-Windows.rdoc for Windows build/installation instructions.

There's also {a Google+ group}[http://goo.gl/TFy1U] and a
{mailing list}[http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-pg] if you get stuck, or just
want to chat about something.

If you want to install as a signed gem, the public certs of the gem signers
can be found in {the `certs` directory}[https://bitbucket.org/ged/ruby-pg/src/tip/certs/]
of the repository.


== Type Casts

Pg can optionally type cast result values and query parameters in Ruby or
native C code. This can speed up data transfers to and from the database,
because String allocations are reduced and conversions in (slower) Ruby code
can be omitted.

Very basic type casting can be enabled by:

    conn.type_map_for_results = PG::BasicTypeMapForResults.new conn
    # ... this works for result value mapping:
    conn.exec("select 1, now(), '{2,3}'::int[]").values
        # => [[1, 2014-09-21 20:51:56 +0200, [2, 3]]]

    conn.type_map_for_queries = PG::BasicTypeMapForQueries.new conn
    # ... and this for param value mapping:
    conn.exec_params("SELECT $1::text, $2::text, $3::text", [1, 1.23, [2,3]]).values
        # => [["1", "1.2300000000000000E+00", "{2,3}"]]

But Pg's type casting is highly customizable. That's why it's divided into
2 layers:

=== Encoders / Decoders (ext/pg_*coder.c, lib/pg/*coder.rb)

This is the lower layer, containing encoding classes that convert Ruby
objects for transmission to the DBMS and decoding classes to convert
received data back to Ruby objects. The classes are namespaced according
to their format and direction in PG::TextEncoder, PG::TextDecoder,
PG::BinaryEncoder and PG::BinaryDecoder.

It is possible to assign a type OID, format code (text or binary) and
optionally a name to an encoder or decoder object. It's also possible
to build composite types by assigning an element encoder/decoder.
PG::Coder objects can be used to set up a PG::TypeMap or alternatively
to convert single values to/from their string representation.

=== PG::TypeMap and derivations (ext/pg_type_map*.c, lib/pg/type_map*.rb)

A TypeMap defines which value will be converted by which encoder/decoder.
There are different type map strategies, implemented by several derivations
of this class. They can be chosen and configured according to the particular
needs for type casting. The default type map is PG::TypeMapAllStrings.

A type map can be assigned per connection or per query respectively per
result set. Type maps can also be used for COPY in and out data streaming.
See PG::Connection#copy_data .
