== Master

Current with 3.0.2

== 3.0.2 2016-11-18

Improvements:

Breaking Changes:
* Changes: custom parameters now specified using an array syntax

Improvements:
* Issue # 128, #137 are fixed (custom parameters passed as strings) which was caused
  by 2.1.0 in attempting to avoid the use of shell and filename escaping issues
  on various platforms.

New:
* Issue #135, Support creating slideshows from stills

== 0.8.5 2011-03-05

* Added encoding option seek_time (thanks to Misty De Meo)

== 0.8.3 2011-09-01

* Parameters now come in the order of codecs, presets, others so that we can override the presets
* Added encoding option keyframe_interval to set number of frames between i-frames (aka GOP size)

* Cropping options now handled by EncodingOptions (croptop, cropbottom, cropleft and cropright)
