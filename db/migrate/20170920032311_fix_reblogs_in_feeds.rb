    # Old scheme:
    # Each user's feed zset had a series of score:value entries,
    # where "regular" statuses had the same score and value (their
    # ID). Reblogs had a score of the reblogging status' ID, and a
    # value of the reblogged status' ID.

    # New scheme:
    # The feed contains only entries with the same score and value.
    # Reblogs result in the reblogging status being added to the
    # feed, with an entry in a reblog tracking zset (where the score
    # is once again set to the reblogging status' ID, and the value
    # is set to the reblogged status' ID). This is safe for Redis'
    # float conversion because in this reblog tracking zset, we only
    # need the reblogging status' ID to be able to stop tracking
    # entries after they have gotten too far down the feed, which
    # does not require an exact value.

    # This process reads all feeds and writes 3 times for each reblogs.
    # So we use Lua script to avoid overhead between Ruby and Redis.

    # We *deliberately* do nothing here. This means that reverting
    # this and the associated changes to the FeedManager code could
    # allow one superfluous reblog of any given status, but in the case
    # where things have gone wrong and a revert is necessary, this
    # appears preferable to requiring a database hit for every status
    # in every users' feed simply to revert.

    # Note that this is operating under the assumption that entries
    # with >53-bit IDs have already been entered. Otherwise, we could
    # just use the data in Redis to reverse this transition.
