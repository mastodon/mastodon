def each_schema_load_environment
  # If we're in development, also run this for the test environment.
  # This is a somewhat hacky way to do this, so here's why:
  # 1. We have to define this before we load the schema, or we won't
  #    have a timestamp_id function when we get to it in the schema.
  # 2. db:setup calls db:schema:load_if_ruby, which calls
  #    db:schema:load, which we define above as having a prerequisite
  #    of this task.
  # 3. db:schema:load ends up running
  #    ActiveRecord::Tasks::DatabaseTasks.load_schema_current, which
  #    calls a private method `each_current_configuration`, which
  #    explicitly also does the loading for the `test` environment
  #    if the current environment is `development`, so we end up
  #    needing to do the same, and we can't even use the same method
  #    to do it.
