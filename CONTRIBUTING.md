## Pull requests

### Size and scope

The smaller and more focused a set of changes in a Pull Request is, the easier
it is to review. Splitting tasks into multiple smaller PRs is often preferable.
Team time is limited and pull requests making large sprawling changes are harder
to review and less likely to get any feedback at all. If your change only makes
sense in some larger context of future changes, note that in the description,
but still aim to keep each distinct PR to a "smallest viable change" size.

### Description of changes

Unless the Pull Request is about refactoring code, updating dependencies or
other internal tasks, assume that the person reading the PR is not a programmer
or Mastodon developer, but a Mastodon user or server admin, and try to describe
things from their perspective.

We use commit squashing, so the final commit in the main branch will carry the
title and description from the Pull Request. Commits from the main branch are
then fed into the changelog and ultimately into release notes. We try to follow
the [keepachangelog] spec, and while that does not prescribe how the entries
ought to be named, for easier sorting, starting your pull request titles using
one of the verbs "Add", "Change", "Deprecate", "Remove", or "Fix" (present
tense) is helpful when it makes sense.

Example:

| Not ideal                            | Better                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fixed NoMethodError in RemovalWorker | Fix nil error when removing statuses caused by race condition |

### Technical requirements

Pull requests that do not pass automated checks on CI may not be reviewed. In
particular, please keep in mind:

- Unit and integration tests (rspec, jest)
- Code style rules (rubocop, eslint)
- Normalization of locale files (i18n-tasks)
- Relevant accessibility or performance concerns
