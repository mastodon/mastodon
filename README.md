Mastodon is a **free, open-source social network server** based on ActivityPub where users can follow friends and discover new ones. On Mastodon, users can publish anything they want: links, pictures, text, and video. All Mastodon servers are interoperable as a federated network (users on one server can seamlessly communicate with users from another one, including non-Mastodon software that implements ActivityPub!)

## Features

<img src="/app/javascript/images/elephant_ui_working.svg?raw=true" align="right" width="30%" />

### No vendor lock-in: Fully interoperable with any conforming platform

It doesn't have to be Mastodon; whatever implements ActivityPub is part of the social network! [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/why-activitypub-is-the-future/)

### Real-time, chronological timeline updates

Updates of people you're following appear in real-time in the UI via WebSockets. There's a firehose view as well!

### Media attachments like images and short videos

Upload and view images and WebM/MP4 videos attached to the updates. Videos with no audio track are treated like GIFs; normal videos loop continuously!

### Safety and moderation tools

Mastodon includes private posts, locked accounts, phrase filtering, muting, blocking, and all sorts of other features, along with a reporting and moderation system. [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/)

### OAuth2 and a straightforward REST API

Mastodon acts as an OAuth2 provider, so 3rd party apps can use the REST and Streaming APIs. This results in a rich app ecosystem with a lot of choices!

## Deployment

### Tech stack

- **Ruby on Rails** powers the REST API and other web pages
- **React.js** and **Redux** are used for the dynamic parts of the interface
- **Node.js** powers the streaming API

### Requirements

- **PostgreSQL** 12+
- **Redis** 4+
- **Ruby** 3.1+
- **Node.js** 18+

The repository includes deployment configurations for **Docker and docker-compose** as well as specific platforms like **Heroku**, and **Scalingo**. For Helm charts, reference the [mastodon/chart repository](https://github.com/mastodon/chart). The [**standalone** installation guide](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/install/) is available in the documentation.

## Development

### Vagrant

A **Vagrant** configuration is included for development purposes. To use it, complete the following steps:

- Install Vagrant and Virtualbox
- Install the `vagrant-hostsupdater` plugin: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`
- Run `vagrant up`
- Run `vagrant ssh -c "cd /vagrant && bin/dev"`
- Open `http://mastodon.local` in your browser

### macOS

To set up **macOS** for native development, complete the following steps:

- Install [Homebrew] and run `brew install postgresql@14 redis imagemagick
libidn nvm` to install the required project dependencies
- Use a Ruby version manager to activate the ruby in `.ruby-version` and run
  `nvm use` to activate the node version from `.nvmrc`
- Run the `bin/setup` script, which will install the required ruby gems and node
  packages and prepare the database for local development
- Finally, run the `bin/dev` script which will launch services via `overmind`
  (if installed) or `foreman`

### Docker

For production hosting and deployment with **Docker**, use the `Dockerfile` and
`docker-compose.yml` in the project root directory.

For local development, install and launch [Docker], and run:

```shell
docker compose -f .devcontainer/compose.yaml up -d
docker compose -f .devcontainer/compose.yaml exec app bin/setup
docker compose -f .devcontainer/compose.yaml exec app bin/dev
```

### Dev Containers

Within IDEs that support the [Development Containers] specification, start the
"Mastodon on local machine" container from the editor. The necessary `docker
compose` commands to build and setup the container should run automatically. For
**Visual Studio Code** this requires installing the [Dev Container extension].

### GitHub Codespaces

[GitHub Codespaces] provides a web-based version of VS Code and a cloud hosted
development environment configured with the software needed for this project.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)][codespace]

- Click the button to create a new codespace, and confirm the options
- Wait for the environment to build (takes a few minutes)
- When the editor is ready, run `bin/dev` in the terminal
- Wait for an _Open in Browser_ prompt. This will open Mastodon
- On the _Ports_ tab "stream" setting change _Port visibility_ ‚Üí _Public_
